## Introduction

Choosing a good wine can be a daunting task, especially with the overwhelming options available in the market. Vino Verdict aims to demystify this process. Our project utilizes sentiment analysis to parse through a plethora of wine reviews and provide an easily understandable score from 1-10.

We are using a robust dataset of wine reviews obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews), providing us with a rich text dataset to train our models.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring the data for sentiment analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Converting text data into a suitable format for model input.
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implementing transfer learning using a pre-trained model and evaluating its performance.
4. **Model Optimization**: Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.
5. **Model Deployment & User Interface**: Creating a user-friendly interface where users can receive a sentiment score for a wine review.
